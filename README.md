## Single Page App for Bootbadges

This is a simple SPA app that records and shows all the bootbadges of all the members of our cohort - the Fiery Skippers!

### Layout

This is a completely decoupled app with a Rails backend serving JSON and with handlebars in the front end running a simple Ruby server.

Along with this, instead of implementing the Web API calls with the JQuery library, the 'JQuery' library incorporated in this app was created from scratch - you can see the 'mini' JQuery library in app/js/miniQuery.js.
